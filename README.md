======

Demo/example of an app using react-three. Also uses [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)
along with its devtools.

## Running the example

Right now this demo requires the `next` branch of [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

So first you'll have to clone the redux-devtools repository and build the `next` branch.

Checkout this repo from git, then

```
npm install <your local redux-devtools build>
npm install
npm run dev
```

And point your browser at `localhost:8081`
